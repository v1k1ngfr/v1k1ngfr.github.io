# About this kind of blog
Hi there !

From my point of view Hacking includes sharing. This place dumps stuffs I found interesting during my infosec journey, so I can at least retrieve those notes easily and maybe it can be helpful for others.

# About me
I discovered Hacking during the late 90s and I'm still amazed by all those fun topics were somebody interacting in an unexpected way with something can get fun results :-)
